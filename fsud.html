    <h1>Food Server UX Design</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p> 
                30% of food goes to waste per year in Nigeria. The strategy team at Food Server has identified a lack of general knowledge about food waste and limited understanding about personal impact as crucial drivers for continued food waste. 
            </p>

        <h2>ROLE</h2>
            <p>
                UX designer leading the app and responsive website design from conception to delivery
            </p>

        <h2>GOAL</h2>
            <p>
                The goal is to Design an app that will improve education on the topic of food waste and help people manage their own food waste.  
            </p>

        <h2>Duration</h2>
            <p>
                January 1 2022 – January 20 2022
            </p>

        <h2>RESEARCH STUDY DETAILS</h2>
            <p>
                I used Food Server data on food waste to develop interview questions, which were then used to conduct user interviews. Most interview participants reported feeling badly about food waste, but they didn’t actively try to reduce their own food waste. The feedback received through research made it very clear that users would be open and willing to work towards eliminating food waste if they had access to an easy-to-use tool to help guide them.

            <h2>UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM</h2>
                <p>
                    I did a quick ideation exercise to come up with ideas for how to address gaps identified in the competitive audit. My focus was specifically on waste tracking and simple recipe features.

                <p>
                    Created a problem statement that will help the ideation process and make it simple for the design team to work on the project seamlessly.

            <h2>THE PROCESS</h2>
                <p>
                    With the app designs completed, I started work on designing the responsive website. I used the Food Saver sitemap to guide the organizational structure of each screen’s design to ensure a cohesive and consistent experience across devices.

            <p>
                Recipes <br>
                People want easy access to recipes that specifically use the food they already own.

            <p>
                Add food <br>
                People had difficulty adding new food items to the app.
            </p>
        
        
            <p>
                Add to Cart <br>
                People preferred clear indications of when food items is aded to cart.

            <p>
                After ideating and drafting some paper wireframes, I created the initial designs for the Food Server app. These designs focused on delivering personalized guidance to users to help manage their food

            <h2>LOW FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h2>
                <p>
                    To prepare for usability testing, I created a low-fidelity prototype that connected the user flow of viewing an item and using it in a recipe.

                <p>
                    Based on the insights from the usability studies, I applied design changes like providing a clear section from the home screen to browse recipes that specifically use items available in “My Food”.

                <p>
                    IMPACT: <br>
                    Users shared that the app made food waste seem like something they could actually help reduce. One quote from peer feedback was that “the Food Server app helps bring caring about the environment to a personal level in a way that’s easy and engaging.”

            <p>
                WHAT I LEARNED: <br>
                I learned that even though the problem I was trying to solve was a big one, diligently going through each step of the design process and aligning with specific user needs helped me come up with solutions that were both feasible and useful.
