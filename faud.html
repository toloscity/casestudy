                <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

                 <h2>ROLE</h2>
                    <p>UX Designer, User Research, Interaction, Visual Design, 
                       Prototyping and Testing from conception to delivery
                    </p>
    
                <h2>GOAL</h2>
                    <p>The goal of this particular project was to 
                       design a an app for Montreal that allows users to easily order and pick up fresh healthy meal

                <h2>DURATION</h2>
                    <p>April 2021 – December 2021</p>
    
                <h2>RESEARCH STUDY DETAILS</h2>
                    <p>I conduced interviews and created empathy map to understand the users I am designing for and their needs. A primary user group identified through the research was working adults who don’t have time to cook.
                        This research also revels the time was not the only factor limiting users from cooking at home. Other users problems includes Obligations, interest or challenges that makes it difficult to get groceries fro cooking or go to restaurant in person

            <h2>KEY CHALLENGES</h2>
           
                <p>IA <br>
                    Text-heavy menus in apps are often difficult to read and order from

                <h2>INITIAL DESIGN CONCEPT</h2>
                    <p>
                        Next , I sketch out paper wireframe s for each screen in my app, keeping the users pain points about navigation,Taking time to draft, iteration of each screen of the app on paper ensured that the elements that made it to digital wireframe will be well suited to address user pain point.

                    <p>
                        As the initial design phase continued, I made sure t o base screen designs on feedback and findings from the user search.

                    <p>
                        Moving from paper to digital wireframe made it easy to understand how the redesign could help address user pain points and improve the users expereince.
                        Prioritizing useful button locations and visual element placement on the home page was a key of my strategy

                        Based on the insights from the usability studies, I applied design changes like providing a clear section from the home screen to searching for meal

                    Try to explore as much as possible and keep your portfolio extensive at an early stage so that you never miss on any opportunity t learn new skills

                <p>WHAT I LEARNT <br>
                    While designing the app, I learnt that the first idea for the app are only the beginning of the process. Usability study and peer feedback influences each iteration of the app designs

                <p>
                    Conduct another usability study to validate if the pain points users experience have been addressed effectively. To continue to improve on my designing skills
