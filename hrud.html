                </p>
    
            <h2>ROLE</h2>
                <p>
                    Product Designer,
                    User Research, Interaction, Visual Design

            <h2>GOAL</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of this particular project was to 
                    design a R-WAREHOUSE Website to be user friendly by providing clear navigation and offering a fast checkout process.

                </p>
            <h2>RESEARCH STUDY DETAILS</h2>
                <p>
                    I conducted user interviews, which I then turned into empathy map to better understand the target user and their needs. I discovered that many target users treat online searching for properties to buy or rent as fun and relaxing activity. However, many online website are overwhelming and confusing to navigate, which frustrated many targeted users. This cause a normally enjoyable experience to become challenging for them, thereby defeating the purpose of fun derived from the activity.

                <p>
                    After collecting the recordings from the user interviews, I conducted affinity mapping with my teammate to synthesize the pains identified. We grouped these problems under common themes and features in the platform.

        <h2>KEY CHALLENGES AND CONSTRAINTS</h2>
       
        <p>
            Navigation <br>
            Buying, Renting Property website designs are often busy, which results in confusing navigation

       </div>
       
            <p>
                Interaction <br>
                Small button on the website makes selection of items dificult, which sometimes leads users to make mistakes.
            </p>
       </div>
       
            <p>
                Experience <br>
                Online Renting or buying website did not provide an engaging browsing experience
            </p>
       
       
            <p>
                Layout <br>
                Layout and font size of text and other component are small and difficult to see thereby  stressing the eyes to view them
            </p>

        <h2>INITIAL DESIGN CONCEPT</h2>
        
            <p>
                Next , I sketch out paper wireframe s for each screen in my app, keeping the users pain points about navigation, browsing and checkout flow in mind. 
                The home screen paper wireframe focuses on optimizing the browsing experience for users.
        
                <br>
                Because R-Warehouse customers access the site on a variety of different devices. I started to work on designs for additional screen sizes to make sure the site would be fully responsive.

        <h2>SKETCH AND WIREFRAMES</h2>
        
            <p>Moving from paper to digital wireframe made it easy to understand how the redesign could help address user pain points and improve the users expereince.
                <br>
                Prioritizing useful button locations and visual element placement on the home page was a key of my strategy

        <h2>MOCKUPS: SCREEN SIZE VARIATIONS</h2>
        
            <p>
                I included consideration for additional screen sizes in my mockups based on my earlier wireframes. Because users browse from variety of devices, I fekt it was important to optimize the browsing experience for a range of devices size such as desktop and mobile so users have smoothest experience possible.

        <h2>TAKEAWAYS</h2>
       
            <p>
                IMPACT: <br> 
                Our target users shared that the design was intuitive to navigate through more engaging with the images, and demonstrated a clear visual hierarchy.
            </p>
        
        
            <p>
                WHAT I LEARNED: <br>
                I learned that even a small design change can have a huge impact on a user experience. The most important takeaway for me is to always focus on the real need of the user when coming up with design ideas and solutions.
